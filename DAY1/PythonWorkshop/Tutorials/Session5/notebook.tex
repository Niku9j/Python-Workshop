\section{ Twitter }\label{twitter}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Twitter can also be used to retrieve information about the tweets,
  connections, or followers of a user, or topics trending on Twitter.
\item
  Information is shared on Twitter in the form of tweets. A tweet may
  contain photos, videos, links, and up to 140 characters of text.
\item
  Twitter provides several APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to
  access Twitter data such as user's profile information or tweets
\item
  An API request on Twitter is first authenticated using Open
  Authentication (OAuth). OAuth allows the users to connect to Twitter
  and send authorized Twitter API request.
\item
  For performing analysis on Twitter data, we need the package tweepy.

}\label{collecting-tweets-having-specific-words}

    \begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{StreamListener class}: used for collecting streaming tweets.
\item
  Class MyStreamListener inherits the class StreamListener of the tweepy
  module.
\item
  In the class MyStreamListener, we define two methods: on\_status and
  on\_error.

\begin{verbatim}
* The method on_status tells what to do when a status (input parameter) 
  known as tweet update is received.  
* The method on_error handles the error and gets automatically invoked
  on occurrence of an error.
\end{verbatim}
